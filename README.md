**Certificates**

I am organising here all the certificates I got since I started my 
PhD Candidate Prep in Computational Cognitive Science | Building Math/Neuro/RL Foundations

I organised a study plan which is specified [PhD prep repo](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep), where I'm uploading further content other than the certificates.

Also, the [Research and QI portfolio](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-QI-portfolio) has further information regarding applied concepts and outputs.
